üî¨ Data Collection Summary
Data was recorded using Shimmer wearable sensors and Consensys software.

Participants were exposed to different emotional stimuli or performed various tasks.

Signals include Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG).

Each data point is labeled with the corresponding emotional or cognitive state.

üß™ Features Included in Each File
Column Name	Description
Shimmer_FCF4_TimestampSync_Unix_CAL	Original timestamp from the sensor in Unix time format
time_in_minutes	Time since start of recording, in minutes
Shimmer_FCF4_GSR_Skin_Conductance_CAL	Raw GSR signal (skin conductance)
Shimmer_FCF4_PPG_A13_CAL	Raw PPG signal (infrared component)
Normalized_GSR	GSR signal normalized (e.g., min-max scaled)
Normalized_PPG	PPG signal normalized
rmssd	Root mean square of successive differences (HRV feature)
Event_Label	Original label describing participant's state (e.g., "Relaxed", "Stress")

The unique labels in the Event_Label columns are:

Relaxation, CPT Test, Stroop Test, Math Test, Video 1 (Sad video), Video 2( Funny video)
For brinary stress classification, Relaxation, Video1 and Video 2 can be non stress states while the rest are stress state.
